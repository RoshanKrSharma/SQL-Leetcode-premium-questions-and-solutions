-- Solution
select id,
case when p_id is null then 'Root'
when id not in (select p_id from tree where p_id is not null group by p_id) then 'Leaf'
else 'Inner'
end as Type
from tree
order by id

-- Alternate solution:
select
distinct (t1.id),
case
when t1.p_id is null then "Root"
when t1.p_id is not null and
t2.id is not null then "Inner"
else "Leaf"
end as Type
from
Tree t1
left join
Tree t2
on t1.id = t2.p_id
